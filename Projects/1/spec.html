<h2>Programming Assignment 1<br />
You're Darn Tootin'!</h2>
<p>
<strong>Time due: 11:00 PM Wednesday, January 17</strong>
</p>
</div>
<p>
The appendix to this document is the specification of the last CS 31 project
from a previous quarter.  We will provide you with a
correct<a href="#endnote1"><sup>1</sup></a><a id="ref1"></a> solution to
that project.  Your assignment is to (1) organize the code for the
solution in appropriate header and implementation files, and (2) implement
a new feature.
</p><p>
You should read <a href="cs31p7spec.html">the appendix</a> now.  It describes
a game in which a player has to avoid passing out in a city of bean eaters.
You will be working with <a href="cs31p7soln.cpp">this code that implements the
game</a>.  Notice that it is a single file.  (Just so you know,
<a href="cs31p7testing.html">the way we tested its correctness</a> is similar
to how we'll test the correctness of the programs you write in CS 32.)
</p>
<h3>Organize the code</h3>
<p>
Take the single source file, and divide it into appropriate header files and
implementation files, one pair of files for each class.  Place the main
routine in its own file named <code>main.cpp</code>.  Make sure each file
<code>#include</code>s the headers it needs.  Each header file must
have include guards.
</p><p>
Now what about the global constants?  Place them in their own header
file named <code>globals.h</code>.  And what about utility functions like
<code>randInt</code> or <code>clearScreen</code> that are used by
more than one class implementation?  Place them in their own
implementation file named <code>utilities.cpp</code>, and place their
prototype declarations in <code>globals.h</code>.  (Note that for a utility
function like <code>decodeDirection</code> that is used by only one class
implementation, it would be better to declare and implement it in that
class's implementation file, not in <code>globals.h</code> and
<code>utilities.cpp</code>.  Also, note that in addition to City, the
implementation of the History class described below will use
<code>clearScreen</code>.)
</p><p>
The <a href="../../visualcpp.html">Visual C++</a> and the
<a href="../../xcode.html">Xcode</a> writeups demonstrate how to create a
multi-file project.  From the collection of the eleven files produced as a
result of this part of the project, make sure you can build an executable
file that behaves exactly the same way as the original single-file
program.  Make sure you can also do this with <a href="../../linux.html">g++
with Linux</a>.
</p>
<h3>Add a feature</h3>
<p>
If you try running the updated programs (the
<a href="newtoot.exe">Windows version</a>, the
<a href="newtootmac.zip">Mac version</a>, or the
<a href="newtoot.linux">Linux version</a> of the full game, and the
<a href="newminitoot.exe">Windows version</a>, the
<a href="newminitootmac.zip">Mac version</a>, or the
<a href="newminitoot.linux">Linux version</a> of the smaller version of
the game), you'll see they have one new command you can type:
<code>h</code> for history.  This command shows you for each grid point how
many times at that location a Tooter at that location was preached to but was
not converted:  dot means 0 times, a letter character A through Y means 1
through 25 times (A means 1, B means 2, etc.) and Z means 26 or more times.
</p><p>
(You can run the Linux version by logging in to cs32.seas.ucla.edu and running
the command <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/newtoot</code> or
<code>/usr/local/cs/bin/newminitoot</code>.  On a Mac, if you click on
the downloaded zip file and then double-click on the executable file
(e.g., newtootmac), your operating system may refuse to open it because
it can't confirm who developed the program.  In that case, right-click on the
executable instead, select Open With and then Terminal.app.  Select the gray
Open button on the popup that again says it doesn't know the developer.)
</p><p>
Your task is to implement this functionality.  You will need to do the
following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Define a class named <code>History</code> with the following public interface:
</p>
<pre>
	class History
	{
	  public:
	    History(int nRows, int nCols);
	    bool record(int r, int c);
	    void display() const;
	};
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
The constructor initializes a History object that corresponds to a City with
<code>nRows</code> rows and <code>nCols</code> columns.  You may assume (i.e.,
you do not have to check) that it will be called with a first argument that
does not exceed <code>MAXROWS</code> and a second that does not exceed
<code>MAXCOLS</code>, and that neither argument will be less than 1.
</li>
<li>
The <code>record</code> function is to be called to notify the History object
that a Tooter at row <code>r</code>, column <code>c</code> was preached to
but not converted.  The function returns false if row <code>r</code>, column
<code>c</code> is not within the City; otherwise, it returns true after
recording what it needs to.  This function expects its parameters to be
expressed in the same coordinate system as the City (e.g., row 1, column 1 is
the upper-left-most position).
</li>
<li>
The <code>display</code> function clears the screen and displays the history
grid as the posted programs do.  This function <em>does</em> clear the
screen, display the history grid, and write an empty line after the
history grid; it does <em>not</em> print the <code>Press enter to
continue.</code> after the display (which should be done somewhere else in
the program).  (Note to Xcode users:  It is acceptable that clearScreen()
just writes a newline instead of clearing the screen if you launch your
program from within Xcode, since the Xcode output window doesn't have the
capability of being cleared.) 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The class declaration (with any private members you choose to add to support
your implementation) must be in a file named <code>History.h</code>, and
the implementation of the History class's member functions must be in
<code>History.cpp</code>.  If you wish, you may add a public destructor to the
History class.  You must <em>not</em> add any other <em>public</em> members
to the class.  (This implies, for example, that you must <em>not</em> add
a public default constructor.)  The only member function of the History
class that may write to <code>cout</code> is <code>History::display</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add a data member of type History (<em>not</em> of type pointer-to-History) to
the City class, and provide this public function to access it; it must return
a <em>reference</em> to the City's History object.
</p>
<pre>
	class City
	{
	  &hellip;
	  History&amp; history();
	  &hellip;
	};
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When a Tooter is preached to but not converted, its City's history
object must be notified about the position it was at when preached to.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Have the Game recognize the new <code>h</code> command, tell its City's
history object to display the history grid, and then print the <code>Press
enter to continue.</code> prompt and wait for the user to respond.
(<code>cin.ignore(10000,'\n');</code> does that nicely.)  Typing the
<code>h</code> command does not count as the player's turn.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn it in</h3>
<p>
By Tuesday, January 16, there will be a link on the class webpage that will
enable you to turn in your source files.  You do not have to turn in a report
or other documentation for this project.  What you will turn in for this
project will be one zip file containing <em>only</em> the thirteen files you
produced, no more and no less.  The files must have these names
<em>exactly</em>:
</p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td>Tooter.h</td>
<td>Player.h</td>
<td>History.h</td>
<td>City.h</td>
<td>Game.h</td>
<td>globals.h</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tooter.cpp</td>
<td>Player.cpp</td>
<td>History.cpp</td>
<td>City.cpp</td>
<td>Game.cpp</td>
<td>utilities.cpp</td>
<td>main.cpp</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The zip file itself may be named whatever you like.
</p><p>
If we take these thirteen source files, we must be able to successfully
build an executable using
g32<a href="#endnote2"><sup>2</sup></a><a id="ref2"></a> and one using
either Visual C++ or clang++ &mdash; you must not introduce compilation or
link errors.
</p><p>
If you do not follow the requirements in the above paragraphs, your score on
this project will be zero.  "Do you mean that if I do everything right except
misspell a file name or include an extra file or leave off one semicolon,
I'll get no points whatsoever?"  Yes.  That seems harsh, but attention to
detail is an important skill in this field.  A draconian grading policy
certainly encourages you to develop this skill.
</p><p>
The only exception to the requirement that the zip file contain exactly
thirteen files of the indicated names is that if you create the zip file
under macOS, it is acceptable if it contains the additional files that
the macOS zip utility sometimes introduces:  <code>__MACOSX</code>,
<code>.DS_Store</code>, and names starting with <code>._</code> that
contain your file names.
</p><p>
To not get a zero on this project, your program must meet these requirements
as well:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Except to add the member function <code>City::history</code> or to change
<code>string</code> to <code>std::string</code>, you must not make any
additions or changes to the public interface of any of the classes.  (You
are free to make changes to the private members and to the implementations
of the member functions.)  The word <code>friend</code> and the word
sequence <code>pragma once</code> must not appear in any of the files you
submit.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Your program must not use any global variables whose values may change
during execution.  Global <em>constants</em> (e.g. <code>MAXROWS</code>)
are all right.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Except in <code>Game::play</code> (or a function it calls) and
<code>History::display</code>, your program must write no output to
<code>cout</code> beyond what is already in the program or is required by
this spec.  If you want to print things out for debugging purposes, write
to <code>cerr</code> instead of <code>cout</code>.  When we test your
program, we will cause everything written to <code>cerr</code> to be
discarded instead &mdash; we will never see that output, so you may leave
those debugging output statements in your program if you wish.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
If we replace your <code>main.cpp</code> file with the following, the program
must build successfully under both g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++:
</p>
<pre>
	#include "Tooter.h"
	int main()
	{}
</pre>
<p>
Furthermore, if <code>Tooter.h</code> contains the line <code>#include
"<em>XXXXX</em>.h"</code>, where <em>XXXX</em> represents any of
<code>Game</code>, <code>City</code>, <code>History</code>,
<code>Player</code>, <code>Tooter</code>, or <code>globals</code>, and if
removing that <code>#include "<em>XXXX</em>.h"</code> line from
<code>Tooter.h</code> still allows the above program to build
successfully, then <code>Tooter.h</code> must not contain that
<code>#include "<em>XXXX</em>.h"</code> line.  For example, if
<code>Tooter.h</code> contained <code>#include "Game.h"</code>, but
removing <code>#include "Game.h"</code> from it still allowed the little
three-line program above to build successfully, then
<code>Tooter.h</code> must not contain <code>#include "Game.h"</code>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
If, in the text and little program of the requirement above, you replace all
occurrences of <code>Tooter.h</code> with <code>Player.h</code>, you must
meet the resulting requirement.  Similarly, if you replace all occurrences
of <code>Tooter.h</code> with <code>History.h</code>, you must meet the
resulting requirement.  The same also holds if you replace with
<code>Game.h</code> and with <code>globals.h</code>.  The requirement must
also be met if you replace with <code>City.h</code> with one exception:
<code>City.h</code> should include <code>globals.h</code>.  (Even if
<code>History.h</code> includes <code>globals.h</code> and
<code>City.h</code> includes <code>History.h</code>, good practice says
that the author of <code>City.h</code> who wants to use
<code>MAXTOOTERS</code> and knows that it's declared in
<code>globals.h</code> shouldn't have to wonder whether some other header
already includes <code>globals.h</code>.)
</p><p>
The point of this requirement and the one above it is that it is good
practice in large programs for a header file to not include headers that
it doesn't appear to need.

If a .cpp file uses a class or function declared in a particular header file,
then it should #include that header.  The idea is that someone writing a .cpp
file should not worry about which header files include other header files.
For example, a .cpp file using an A object and a B object should include
both A.h (where presumably the class A is declared) and B.h (where B is
declared), without considering whether or not A.h includes B.h or vice versa.

To help you more conveniently test the requirements of the form "If we
replace your <code>main.cpp</code> file with the following,...", we're
supplying <a href="testmain.html">a packaging of some Project 1 test
cases</a>.  
</p><p>
To create a zip file on a SEASnet machine, you can select the thirteen
files you want to turn in, right click, and select "Send To / Compressed
(zipped) Folder". Under macOS, copy the files into a new folder, select
the folder in Finder, and select File / Compress "<em>folderName</em>";
make sure you <em>copied</em> the files into the folder instead of
creating aliases to the files.
</p>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<p>
Developing your solution incrementally will make your work easier.  Start
by making sure you can build and run the original program successfully with
the one source file having the name <code>main.cpp</code>.  Then, starting
with Tooter, say, produce <code>Tooter.h</code>, removing the code declaring
the Tooter class from <code>main.cpp</code>, but leaving in
<code>main.cpp</code> the implementation of the Tooter member functions.
Get that two-file solution to work.  Also, make sure you meet those of the
requirements above that involve only the <code>Tooter.h</code> header.
</p><p>
Next, split off <code>Player.h</code>, testing the now three-file solution
and also making sure you meet those of the requirements above that involve
only the <code>Tooter.h</code> and <code>Player.h</code> headers.  Continue
in this manner until you've produced all the required headers (except
<code>History.h</code>, since you're not yet adding the history feature),
the whole program still works, and you meet all the applicable requirements.
</p><p>
Now split off the member function implementations of, say, Tooter, putting
them in <code>Tooter.cpp</code>.  Test everything again.  You see where this
is going.  The basic principle is to <em>not</em> try to produce all the
files at once, because many misconceptions you have will affect many files.
This will make it difficult to fix all those problems, since many of them will
interfere with each other.  By tackling one file at a time, and importantly,
not proceeding to another until you've got everything so far working, you'll
keep the job manageable, increasing the likelihood of completing the project
successfully and, as a nice bonus, reducing the amount of time you spend
working on it.

<h3>Help</h3>
<p>
While we will provide you assistance in clarifying what this assignment is
asking for and in using g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++, we will
otherwise offer minimal help with this assignment.  This is to give you a
chance to honestly evaluate your own current programming ability.  If you
find that you're having trouble with the C++ program itself (not simply
the Visual C++, Xcode, or g++ environment, which may be new to you), then
you may want to reconsider your decision to take this class this quarter.
Perhaps you've let your C++ programming skills get rusty, or maybe you
didn't learn the material in CS 31 or its equivalent very well.  If you
decide to take the course later, what you should do between now and then
is program, program, program!  Solve some old or current CS 31 or PIC 10A
or early PIC 10B projects, and read and do the exercises in a good
introductory programming text using C++.  You'll have to be self-motivated
to make time for that, but the payoff will be a greater likelihood for
success in CS 32.

<a href="#ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> "Correct" in terms of what a CS 31 student
would know.  For example, a CS 31 student wouldn't know that sometimes you
need to write a copy constructor, so the posted solution ignores that
issue.  (You don't have to worry about that issue for this project, either.)

<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As the
<a href="../../requirements.html">Project Requirements</a> document tells
you, "build using g32" is shorthand for "build using g32 on
cs32.seas.ucla.edu" &mdash; that specific command (g32, not g++) on a
SEASnet machine reached via that specific name.
