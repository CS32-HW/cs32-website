<h2>A convenient packaging of some Project 1 test cases</h2>
<p>
The Project 1 spec has a number of requirements that your submissiom must
meet in order to not get a zero.  Many of them are expressed as "If we
replace your <code>main.cpp</code> file with the following, ...".  One way
you could check that you meet such requirements would be to make a lot of
test <code>main.cpp</code> files and one by one, replace your
<code>main.cpp</code> file with each and see if you pass each test.  Doing
that on both your own machine and on the Linux server is a lot of file
replacements.  Wouldn't it be great if there were a way to have one file with
all those test cases, and you just tell the compiler which one to build? 
Good news:  There is!  
</p><p>
If you replace your <code>main.cpp</code> file with <a href="main.cpp">this
test main.cpp file</a>, you can build your program and it will run as before.
But if you uncomment the commented out line near the top that #defines the
symbol TESTNUM as 1, you can replace the 1 with an integer in the range 1 to
20 to cause the compiler to select one of the 20 test cases contained in the
file.  (If you replace the 1 with any other integer or leave the line
commented out, the compiler will use the original code that plays the game.)
</p><p>
To test your code for the 20 cases in the file, just build your program 20
times, replacing the value that TESTNUM is defined as each time, making sure
that the tests that are required to build (numbered 1 to 15 in the file) do
indeed build, that the tests that are required not to build (numbered 16 to
20) do indeed not build, and that the two tests that when run must produce
certain output (numbered 14 and 15) do indeed produce exactly that output. 
You can also use an integer like 0 for TESTNUM to get the main routine that
plays the game.  
</p><p>
When you prepare your zip file to turn in, it is acceptable for the file
named <code>main.cpp</code> in your zip file to be this test
<code>main.cpp</code> file; the line that #defines TESTNUM can be commented
out or can be uncommented with TESTNUM defined as any integer.
</p><p>
When preparing to transfer your files to the Linux server to run under g32,
here's a useful tip:  Comment out the line that #defines TESTNUM if you've 
uncommented it.  Transfer your files to the Linux server.  If you build your
program this way:
</p>
<pre>
	g32 *.cpp -o toot
</pre>
<p>
then you'll produce an executable file named <code>toot</code> that you
can run to play the game.  But if you build it this way:
</p>
<pre>
	g32 -DTESTNUM=7 *.cpp -o toot
</pre>
<p>
then you'll build it with TESTNUM #defined as 7.  Notice that you do
<em>not</em> have to make any change to the test <code>main.cpp</code> file;
the compiler will build your program as if each .cpp file started with
<code>#define TESTNUM 7</code>.  This way you can build your program 20 times
for the 20 test cases in the file without editing the test
<code>main.cpp</code> each time.
