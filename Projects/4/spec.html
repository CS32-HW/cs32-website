<h2>Programming Assignment 4<br />
BruinTour</h2>
<p>
<strong>Due 11:00 PM Thursday, March 14</strong><br/>

<p>
The <a href="spec.pdf">Project 4 specification document</a> has been posted.
</p><p>
The posted <a href="provided.zip">provided code</a> includes a main routine
you can use to test the whole system, as well as the .h files the spec says
we will provide.  Additionally, you can use
<a href="mapdata.txt">mapdata.txt</a> (a large map data file).  You can
create other data files to help you test (e.g. small map data files with
simpler to read numbers).
</p><p>
Just for your information, here are some of the web sites Carey used when
building the map data file:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.latlong.net" target="_blank">http://www.latlong.net</a>
to look up latitude and longitude for any address
</li><li>
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data#Choose_your_region"
target="_blank">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data#Choose_your_region</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>
3/12 10:50pm: Spec p. 27 was updated to clarify that generate_tour should not
generate a turn command for a turn of less than 1 degree or greater than 359
degrees.
</p>
3/10 2:50pm: The spec orignally said to give the file you turn in with your
hash map the name <em>HashMap.h</em>, but everywhere else we call it
<em>hashmap.h</em>.  Just to be consistent, we changed the spec to say it
should be named <em>hashmap.h</em>, but we'll accept either name for the file.
The class itself must be named HashMap.
<p>
3/9 9:20pm: If you can't get your HashMap class to work well enough to make
progress on the other classes that use HashMaps, you can use the
implementation in <a href="scaffoldhashmap.h">scaffoldhashmap.h</a>
temporarily, switch your attention to implementing the other classes, and go
back to working on <en>your</em> HashMap implementation later.  Make sure you
save your current HashMap somewhere else for when you go back to working on it.
(You can't turn in this scaffold implementation as yours, since it uses
unordered_map to implement HashMap, which is forbidden by the spec.)
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
3/8 3:00am: If you downloaded (or viewed in a browser) the spec before 3/8
3:00am, re-download (or reload it in your browser); a number of issues have
been fixed:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0">
<li>
p. 13: The example of how to use HashMap was edited to correct when a rehash
occurs, making it consistent with requirement 7 on p.15.
</li><li>
p. 14: The interface to the <em>find()</em> method has been corrected, and an
overload we have written for you has been added.  The second-to-last paragraph
of p. 15 says a bit about this.  (The paragraph after that is worth reading as
well.)
</li><li>
p. 16, 21, and 25: The interfaces to the three classes on these pages
mistakenly had pure virtual functions, and the methods that should be const
are indeed declared const.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
3/8 1:00am: If you downloaded provided.zip before 3/8 1:00am, re-download it;
the last (I hope) little issue has been fixed.  Each of the six files in the
zip file should replace the ones you dowloaded before.
</p>
<p>
<s>3/6 11:30pm: If you downloaded provided.zip before 3/6 11:30pm, re-download it;
some little issues have been fixed.  Each of the six files in the zip file
should replace the ones you dowloaded before.</s>
</p>
<p>
3/6 11:10pm: If you downloaded mapdata.txt before 3/6 11:10pm, re-download it;
there was an incorrect point of interest count for one of the street segments.
