<strong>In the map data file, must the street segments be listed in an
order that forms one contiguous stretch of roadway?</strong>
</p><p>
No.  The segments listed after the street name in the file may be in any
order and might not form just one contiguous stretch.  For example, consider
this hypothetical street (near Paris, judging by the coordinates):
<p>
<pre>
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#FF0000">45.000 3.000  45.000 3.001</font>
	0
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#FF0000">45.000 3.001  45.001 3.002</font>
	0
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#0000FF">45.001 3.003  45.001 3.004</font>
	0
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#0000FF">45.001 3.004  45.000 3.005</font>
	0
</pre>
<p>
This describes a street with two discontiguous stretches, one from
<font color="#FF0000">(45.000,3.000)</font> east to
<font color="#FF0000">(45.000,3.001)</font> then northeast to
<font color="#FF0000">(45.001,3.002)</font> and one from
<font color="#0000FF">(45.001,3.003)</font> east to
<font color="#0000FF">(45.001,3.004)</font> southeast to
<font color="#0000FF">(45.000,3.005)</font>.  But the file might just as
well list the segments in a different order or the endpoints of a segment in
the opposite order; the same information is conveyed:
</p>
<pre>
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#FF0000">45.000 3.000  45.000 3.001</font>
	0
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#0000FF">45.001 3.004  45.001 3.003</font>
	0
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#FF0000">45.000 3.001  45.001 3.002</font>
	0
	Rue Exemple
	<font color="#0000FF">45.001 3.004  45.000 3.005</font>
	0
</pre>
<p>
It still specifies two discontiguous stretches, one consisting of two segments
connected at <font color="#FF0000">(45.000,3.001)</font> and one consisting of
two segments connected at <font color="#0000FF">(45.001,3.004)</font>.
</p><p>
For the most straighforward implementation of <em>GeoDatabase</em> that we can
think of, the code works the same for either of these arrangements and results
in the same information being stored as a <em>GeoDatabase</em>'s data.

<p>
<strong>Is it correct to say that we must NOT use containers defined in
<code>&lt;map></code>, <code>&lt;set></code>, <code>&lt;unordered_map></code>,
or <code>&lt;unordered_set></code> in our implementations of
<em>HashMap</em> and <em>GeoDatabase</em>, but we ARE allowed to use
them for <em>Router</em> and <em>TourGenerator</em>, and we ARE allowed to
use <em>vector</em>, <em>list</em>, <em>stack</em>, <em>queue</em>, and
<em>priority_queue</em> for any of the five classes?</strong>
</p><p>
Yes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>I've traced through my code to insert something into a HashMap, and
it seems to be doing the right things, but the new association doesn't stay
in my HashMap.  How could that be?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it doesn't stay because it never was there to begin with.  Think about
this:
</p>
<pre>
	int a[10];
	a[2] = 42;
	int x = a[2];
	x = 86;
	cout &lt;&lt; a[2] &lt;&lt; endl;  // writes 42.  Why didn't 86 "stay" there?
	int&amp; y = a[2];
	y = 99;
	cout &lt;&lt; a[2] &lt;&lt; endl;  // writes 99.  Why does 99 stay there?
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>If the street map data file contains more than one point of
interest with the same name (e.g., <code>Northern Cafe|<em>lat<sub>1</sub>
long<sub>1</sub></em></code> and <code>Northern Cafe|<em>lat<sub>2</sub>
long<sub>2</sub></em></code>), what should I do?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Associate that name with just one of the indicated coordinate pairs (e.g.,
<em>lat<sub>2</sub> long<sub>2</sub></em>)&mdash;it's your choice which one,
so depending on how your code is written for the normal case of no duplicate
names, it might just naturally save only the first one you encounter when
processing the file, or perhaps the only last one you encounter).  The
mapdata.txt file we give you has three instances of that situation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>My program seems to run correctly, but runs awfully slowly, and I
know it's not because of bad algorithms (O(N<sup>2</sup>) instead of O(N),
etc.).  How can I speed it up?</strong>
</p><p>
Especially if it's Visual C++, it may be that you're building in the Debug
configuration, which inserts code to check for many STL usage errors.
These are helpful during debugging, but can slow things down.  Follow the
instructions in <a href="../../Homeworks/4/spec.html">Homework 4</a>, problem
7 to build an optimized version.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Do we know enough from this class to do a complexity analysis of
A* or simulated annealing?</strong>
</p>
<p>
No.  If one of those is an approach you took, then in your report, for the
functions for which you implemented A* or simulated annealing, say so and
instead of telling us the big-O for that function, briefly describe the data
structures you used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>If a street segment from point A to point B has a PoI associated with
it, I compute a midpoint M between A and B, and add a segment named "a path"
connecting the PoI to M.  I also connect M to A and B.  Should A also be
directly connected to B?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes.
