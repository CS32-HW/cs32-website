 <title>CS 32 Project 3 Possible Design, Winter 2022</title>

Here is one possible design of the Actor inheritance hierarchy:
</p>
<pre>
GraphObject
    Actor
        Agent
            Player
            Robot
                RageBot
                ThiefBot
                    RegularThiefBot
                    MeanThiefBot
        Exit
        Wall
        Marble
        Pit
        Pea
        ThiefBotFactory
        PickupableItem
            Crystal
            Goodie
                ExtraLifeGoodie
                RestoreHealthGoodie
                AmmoGoodie
</pre>
<p>
You are not obligated to follow this particular design, but you must take
advantage of inheritance to avoid large amounts of repetitive code.  The
technique in item 8 on pp. 48-49 of the spec is especially helpful in
reducing repetition.  For example, suppose you had code like this:
</p>
<pre>
    // Goodie::doSomething() is virtual.

    void ExtraLifeGoodie::doSomething()
    {
        ...
        <em>grant player extra life</em>
        ...
    }

    void RestoreHealthGoodie::doSomething()
    {
        ...
        <em>restore player health</em>
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
where the several lines of omitted code is the same in the two functions.
You might avoid the repeated code by instead doing something like this:
</p>
<pre>
    void Goodie::doSomething()
    {
       ...   <em>(same as the code in the first ... in each function above)</em>
       doActivity();
       ...   <em>(same as the code in the second ... in each function above)</em>
    }

    void ExtraLifeGoodie::doActivity()
    {
        <em>grant player extra life</em>
    }

    void RestoreHealthGoodie::doActivity()
    {
        <em>restore player health</em>
    }
</pre>
<p>
where <code>doActivity</code> is declared pure virtual in Goodie.  This way,
a derived class of Goodie does not have to implement <code>doSomething</code>
at all; it can just inherit Goodie's implementation of <code>doSomething</code>
and provide in the virtual <code>doActivity</code> functions only the code that
is specific to that derived class.
</p><p>
This idea applies in many situations.  For example, suppose you had this:
</p>
<pre>
    void RageBot::doSomething()
    {
        ... <em>code specific to RageBots</em> ...
        ... <em>code common to all robots</em> ...
    }

    void ThiefBot::doSomething()
    {
        ... <em>code specific to ThiefBots</em> ...
        ... <em>code common to all robots</em> ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
You could factor out the common code this way:
</p>
<pre>
    void Robot::doSomething()
    {
        doSomethingForSpecificRobotSubclass();  // declared pure virtual in Robot
        ... <em>code common to all robots</em> ...
    }

    void RageBot::doSomethingforSpecificRobotSubclass()  // private
    {
        ... <em>code specific to RageBots</em> ...
    }

    void ThiefBot::doSomethingforSpecificRobotSubclass()  // private
    {
        ... <em>code specific to ThiefBots</em> ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
Because all of the common code is at one end of the original functions (the
end in this example), another possible refactoring would be this:
</p>
<pre>
    void Robot::doSomething()
    {
        ... <em>code common to all robots</em> ...
    }

    void RageBot::doSomething()
    {
        ... <em>code specific to RageBots</em> ...
        Robot::doSomething();
    }

    void ThiefBot::doSomething()
    {
        ... <em>code specific to ThiefBots</em> ...
        Robot::doSomething();
    }
</pre>
<p>
(In this case, if there was no <em>code specific to RageBots</em>, then
rather than having <code>RageBot::doSomething</code> do nothing more than
call <code>Robot::doSomething</code>, RageBot could simply not declare or
implement <code>doSomething()</code> at all; by saying nothing, it would just
inherit Robot's version.)
</p><p>
The downside to this second approach is that this code still compiles if the
programmer accidentally omitted a call to <code>Robot::doSomething()</code>
in one of the derived class implementations; this code doesn't enforce a
requirement that every derived class's <code>doSomething</code>  must end by
doing the common code.
