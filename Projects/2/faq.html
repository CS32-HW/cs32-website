<strong>
I'm thinking of implementing a private member function that returns a pointer
to a nested class/struct.  How do I do that?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Consider this:
</p>
<pre>
	class M
	{
	  ...
	  struct N
	  {
	    ...
	  };
	  N* f();
	  ...
	};

	N* M::f()     // Error!  Compiler doesn't recognize N.
	{
	  ...
	}

	M::N* M::f()  // Oh, M's N!  This will compile.
	{
	  ...
	}
</pre>
<p>
There's a C++ language rule that says roughly that the return type part of the
definition of a member function of a class M isn't in the scope of M, so a
name from M (like N) needs to be qualified (like M::N).  Oddly enough, the
parameter list <em>is</em> in the scope of M, so if M declared a member
function <code>void g(N* n)</code>, the implementation could begin
<code>void M::g(N* n)</code> if you wish (or <code>void M::g(M::N* n)</code>,
of course).
</p>

<strong>
<p>
Does this compile?  If so, what is its output?
</p>
<pre>
	void f(const int&amp; x, int&amp; y)
	{
	    y = x + 1;
	}

	int main()
	{
	    int k = 0;
	    f(k, k);
	    cout &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
</strong>
<p>
Yes, it compiles, and the output is <code>1</code>.  The declaration 
<code>const int&amp; x</code> says that <em>through the name
<code>x</code></em>, the function is <em>not</em> allowed to modify the object
<code>x</code> refers to, so an assignment like <code>x = 42</code> would not
compile.  The declaration <code>int&amp; y</code> says that <em>through
the name <code>y</code></em>, the function <em>is</em> allowed to modify
the object <code>y</code> refers to.  So in the call <code>f(k, k)</code>,
the function can modify <code>k</code> if it does so through the name
<code>y</code>, but won't even compile if it tries to do so through the name
<code>x</code>.
</p>

<strong>How can I test for memory leaks?</strong>
</p><p>
That's a hard problem in general.  If we limit it to checking whether we leak
any linked list nodes, where each linked list node contains an object of the
ValueType, say, of the Map, then we can do it this way:  Declare the
value type of the Map to be a special class we'll write, one that
will keep track of <em>all</em> creations and deletions of objects of that
special type.  We can do this by instrumenting every constructor and the
destructor of that special class.  Then we run our tests and see if the
number of destructions equals the number of constructions, as shown in some
<a href="memleak.cpp">sample code</a>.
</p><p>
Running our g32 command also helps, since we set it up to invoke g++ with
compiler options that insert code that, when your program finishes, reports
most memory leaks that occurred during execution.
