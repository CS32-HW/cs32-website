Homework 1 gave you extensive experience with the Map type using both
arrays and dynamically-allocated arrays.  In this project, you will
re-write the implementation of the Map type to employ a doubly-linked list
rather than an array.  You must <em>not</em> use arrays.  You will also
implement a couple of algorithms that operate on maps.
</p>
<h4>Implement Map yet again</h4>
<p>
Consider the Map interface from problem 2 of Homework 1:
</p>
<pre>
using KeyType = <em>TheTypeOfTheKeysGoesHere</em>;
using ValueType = <em>TheTypeOfTheValuesGoesHere</em>;

class Map
{
  public:
    Map();
    bool empty() const;
    int size() const;
    bool insert(const KeyType&amp; key, const ValueType&amp; value);
    bool update(const KeyType&amp; key, const ValueType&amp; value);
    bool insertOrUpdate(const KeyType&amp; key, const ValueType&amp; value);
    bool erase(const KeyType&amp; key);
    bool contains(const KeyType&amp; key) const;
    bool get(const KeyType&amp; key, ValueType&amp; value) const;
    bool get(int i, KeyType&amp; key, ValueType&amp; value) const;
    void swap(Map&amp; other);
};
</pre>
<p>
In problem 3 of Homework 1, you implemented this interface using an array.
For this project, implement this Map interface using a doubly-linked
list.  (You must not use the <code>list</code> class template from the
C++ library.)
</p>
<p>
For the array implementation of problem 3 of Homework 1, since you declared no
destructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator, the compiler wrote them
for you, and they did the right thing.  For this linked list implementation,
if you let the compiler write the destructor, copy constructor, and
assignment operator, they will do the wrong thing, so you will have to
declare and implement these public member functions as well:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Destructor</dt>
<dd>When a Map is destroyed, the nodes in the linked list must be
deallocated.</dd>
<dt>Copy constructor</dt>
<dd>When a brand new Map is created as a copy of an existing Map,
enough new nodes must be allocated to hold a duplicate of the original
list.</dd>
<dt>Assignment operator</dt>
<dd>When an existing Map (the left-hand side) is assigned the value of
another Map (the right-hand side), the result must be that the left-hand
side object is a duplicate of the right-hand side object, with no
memory leak of list nodes (i.e. no list node from the old value of the
left-hand side should be still allocated yet inaccessible).</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Notice that there is now no <em>a priori</em> limit on the maximum number
of key/value pairs in the Map (so <code>insertOrUpdate</code> should
always return true).  Notice also that, as in Homework 1, if a Map has a
size of <em>n</em>, then the values of the first parameter to the
three-parameter form of <code>get</code> for which that function retrieves
a key and a value (that were previously inserted by a call to
<code>insert</code>) and returns true are <em>0</em>, <em>1</em>,
<em>2</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>n&minus;1</em>; for other values, it
returns false without setting its second and third parameters.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
        Map msd;  // KeyType is std::string, ValueType is double
        msd.insert("ccc", 80);
        msd.insert("aaa", 40);
        msd.insert("ddd", 60);
        msd.insert("bbb", 20);
        KeyType k = "xxx";
        ValueType v;
        assert(!msd.get(4, k, v)  &amp;&amp;  k == "xxx");  // k and v unchanged
        assert(msd.get(1, k, v)  &amp;&amp;  k == "bbb");   // "bbb" is greater than
                                                    // exactly 1 item
</pre>
<p>
This is the same visible behavior as in Homework 1.
</p><p>
Another requirement is that as in Problem 5 of Homework 1, the number of
statement executions when swapping two maps must be the same no matter how
many key/value pairs are in the maps.
</p>
<h4>Implement some map algorithms</h4>
<p>
Implement the following two functions.  Notice that they are
<em>non-member</em> functions:  They are <em>not</em> members of Map or
any other class, so they must <em>not</em> access <em>private</em> members
of Map.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>bool merge(const Map&amp; m1, const Map&amp; m2, Map&amp; result);</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>
When this function returns, <code>result</code> must consist of pairs
determined by these rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If a key appears in exactly one of <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code>, then
<code>result</code> must contain a pair consisting of that key and its
corresponding value.
</li><li>
If a key appears in both <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code>, with the
same corresponding value in both, then <code>result</code> must contain
exactly one pair with that key and value.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When this function returns, <code>result</code> must contain no pairs
other than those required by these rules.  (You must <em>not</em> assume
<code>result</code> is empty when it is passed in to this function; it
might not be.)
</p>
<p>
If there exists a key that appears in both <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code>,
but with different corresponding values, then this function returns false;
if there is no key like this, the function returns true.  Even if the
function returns false, <code>result</code> must be constituted as defined
by the above rules.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose a Map maps strings to doubles.  If <code>m1</code>
consists of the three pairs
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  123      "Ethel"  456      "Lucy"  789
</pre>
<p>
and <code>m2</code> consists of
</p>
<pre>
     "Lucy"  789      "Ricky"  321
</pre>
<p>
then no matter what value it had before, <code>result</code> must end up as a
map consisting of
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  123      "Ricky"  321      "Lucy"  789     "Ethel"  456
</pre>
<p>
and <code>merge</code> must return true.  If instead, <code>m1</code> were
as before, and <code>m2</code> consisted of
</p>
<pre>
     "Lucy"  654      "Ricky"  321
</pre>
<p>
then no matter what value it had before, <code>result</code> must end up as a
map consisting of
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  123      "Ricky"  321      "Ethel"  456
</pre>
<p>
and <code>merge</code> must return false.
</p>
<p>
(In this and other examples where we say that a map must consist of certain
pairs, the order in which the example shows the pairs is irrelevant:  your
implementation might or might not store them in that order.  Of course, if
the three-argument form of get is called with the first argument 0, it must
retrieve the key with the least value, etc. &mdash; the behavior that a user
of Map sees must be the same as what the Homework 1 spec requires.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>void reassign(const Map&amp; m, Map&amp; result);</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Imagine a dance with two groups of people, K and V, with the same number
of people in each group.  During a dance, each person in group K is dancing
with a person in group V.  At a given signal, they change partners so that
each person in group K is now dancing with a person in group V different from
the person they were dancing with before.
</p>
<p>
When the <code>reassign</code> function returns, <code>result</code> must
contain, for each pair <em>p<sub>1</sub></em> in <code>m</code>, a pair
with <em>p<sub>1</sub></em>'s key mapping to a value copied from a
different pair <em>p<sub>2</sub></em> in <code>m</code>, and no other pair
in <code>result</code> has its value copied from <em>p<sub>2</sub></em>.
(At the dance, if <em>k<sub>1</sub></em>'s original partner
<em>v<sub>1</sub></em> is replaced by <em>k<sub>2</sub></em>'s original
partner <em>v<sub>2</sub></em>, then no person in group K other than
<em>k<sub>1</sub></em> also ends up dancing with <em>v<sub>2</sub></em>.)
However, if <code>m</code> has only one pair, then <code>result</code>
must contain simply a copy of that pair.  (You can't change partners if
you're the only pair dancing!)
</p>
<p>
Upon return, <code>result</code> must contain the same number of pairs as
<code>m</code>; you must <em>not</em> assume <code>result</code> is empty
when it is passed in to this function; it may not be.
</p>
<p>
For example, if <code>m</code> consists of the four pairs
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  123      "Ethel"  456      "Lucy"  789      "Ricky"  321
</pre>
<p>
then no matter what value it had before, <code>result</code> must end up as a
map consisting of one of the following groups of four pairs:
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  456      "Ethel"  123      "Lucy"  321      "Ricky"  789

     "Fred"  456      "Ethel"  789      "Lucy"  321      "Ricky"  123

     "Fred"  456      "Ethel"  321      "Lucy"  123      "Ricky"  789

     "Fred"  789      "Ethel"  123      "Lucy"  321      "Ricky"  456

     "Fred"  789      "Ethel"  321      "Lucy"  123      "Ricky"  456

     "Fred"  789      "Ethel"  321      "Lucy"  456      "Ricky"  123

     "Fred"  321      "Ethel"  123      "Lucy"  456      "Ricky"  789

     "Fred"  321      "Ethel"  789      "Lucy"  123      "Ricky"  456

     "Fred"  321      "Ethel"  789      "Lucy"  456      "Ricky"  123
</pre>
<p>
but not, say, one of these:
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  456      "Ethel"  321      "Lucy"  789      "Ricky"  123

     "Fred"  456      "Ethel"  321      "Lucy"  321      "Ricky"  123
</pre>
<p>
(In the first, Lucy didn't change partners; in the the second, both Ethel and
Lucy ended up with Ricky's original partner.)
</p>
<p>
As another example, if <code>m</code> consists of the three pairs
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  123      "Ethel"  456      "Lucy"  456
</pre>
<p>
then no matter what value it had before, <code>result</code> must end up as a
map consisting of one of the following groups of three pairs:
</p>
<pre>
     "Fred"  456      "Ethel"  123      "Lucy"  456

     "Fred"  456      "Ethel"  456      "Lucy"  123
</pre>
<p>
If the result were the first, Fred must have ended up with Lucy's 456 and
Lucy ended up with Ethel's 456.  In the second case, Fred must have ended up
with Ethel's 456, and Ethel ended up with Lucy's 456.
</p>
<p>
Notice that this spec does not require any particular one of the allowable
reassignments and does not require that the reassignment be randomly chosen.
(Hint:  This function can thus be implemented without its having to repeatedly
examine an auxiliary array or other container that holds a collection of many
items.)
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Be sure that in the face of <em>aliasing</em>, these functions behave
as this spec requires:  Does your implementation work correctly if
<code>m1</code> and <code>result</code> refer to the same Map, for example?
</p>
<h4>Other Requirements</h4>
<p>
Regardless of how much work you put into the assignment, your program will
receive a zero for correctness if you violate these requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Your class definition, declarations for the two required non-member
functions, and the implementations of any functions you choose to inline
must be in a file named <code>Map.h</code>, which must have
appropriate include guards.  The implementations of the functions you
declared in <code>Map.h</code> that you did not inline must be in a file
named <code>Map.cpp</code>.  Neither of those files may have a main
routine (unless it's commented out).  You may use a separate file for the
main routine to test your Map class; you won't turn in that separate file.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Except to add a destructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and
<code>dump</code> function (described below), you must not add functions
to, delete functions from, or change the public interface of the Map
class.  You must not declare any additional struct/class outside the Map
class, and you must not declare any <em>public</em> struct/class inside
the Map class.  You may declare whatever private data members and private
member functions you like, and you may declare <em>private</em>
structs/classes inside the Map class if you like.
</p><p>
If you wish, you may add a public member function with the signature
<code>void dump() const</code>.  The intent of this function is that for
your own testing purposes, you can call it to print information about the
map; we will never call it.  You do not have to add this function if
you don't want to, but if you do add it, it must not make any changes to
the map; if we were to replace your implementation of this function
with one that simply returned immediately, your code must still work
correctly.  The <code>dump</code> function must not write to <code>cout</code>,
but it's allowed to write to <code>cerr</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The source files you submit for this project must not contain the word
<code>friend</code> or <code>pragma</code> or <code>vector</code> or the
character <code>[</code> (open square bracket).  You must not use any
global variables whose values may be changed during execution.  (Global
<em>constants</em> are fine.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>Map.cpp</code> must not contain the word <code>string</code> or
<code>double</code>.  (<code>Map.h</code> may contain them only in using
statements introducing type aliases, and must contain
<code>#include &lt;string></code> if a using statement introducing a type
alias contains the word <code>string</code>.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Your code must build successfully (under both g32 and either Visual C++ or
clang++) if linked with a file that contains a main routine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You must have an implementation for every member function of Map, as well
as the non-member functions <code>merge</code> and <code>reassign</code>.
Even if you can't get a function implemented correctly, it must have an
implementation that at least builds successfully.  For example, if you
don't have time to correctly implement <code>Map::erase</code> or
<code>reassign</code>, say, here are implementations that meet this
requirement in that they at least build successfully:
</p>
<pre>
        bool Map::erase(const KeyType&amp; value)
        {
            return false;  // not correct, but at least this compiles
        }

        void reassign(const Map&amp; m, Map&amp; result)
        {
            // does nothing; not correct, but at least this compiles
        }
</pre>
<p>
You've probably met this requirement if the following file compiles and links
with your code.  (This uses magic beyond the scope of CS 32.)
</p>
<pre>
        #include "Map.h"
        #include &lt;type_traits>

        #define CHECKTYPE(c, f, r, a)  \

If you add <code>#include &lt;string></code> to <code>Map.h</code>, have

If we successfully do the above, then make no changes to <code>Map.h</code>
other than to change the type aliases for Map so that <code>KeyType</code>

<p>
During execution, if a client performs actions whose behavior is defined
by this spec, your program must not perform any undefined actions, such as
dereferencing a null or uninitialized pointer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Your code in <code>Map.h</code> and <code>Map.cpp</code> must not read
anything from <code>cin</code> and must not write anything whatsoever to
<code>cout</code>.  If you want to print things out for debugging
purposes, write to <code>cerr</code> instead of <code>cout</code>.
<code>cerr</code> is the standard error destination; items written to it
by default go to the screen.  When we test your program, we will cause
everything written to <code>cerr</code> to be discarded instead &mdash; we
will never see that output, so you may leave those debugging output
statements in your program if you wish.

By Monday, January 29, there will be a link on the class webpage that will
enable you to turn in your source files and report.  You will turn in a zip
file containing these three files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>Map.h</code>.  When you turn in this file, the using statements must
specify <code>std::string</code> as the <code>KeyType</code> and
<code>double</code> as the <code>ValueType</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>Map.cpp</code>.  Function implementations should be appropriately
commented to guide a reader of the code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>report.docx</code> (in Microsoft Word format) or
<code>report.txt</code> (an ordinary text file) that contains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
a description of the design of your doubly-linked list implementation. (A
couple of sentences will probably suffice, perhaps with a picture of a
typical Map and an empty Map.  Is the list circular?  Does it have a dummy
node?  What's in your list nodes?  Are they in any particular order?)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="../../pseudocode.html">pseudocode</a> for non-trivial algorithms
(e.g., <code>Map::erase</code> and <code>reassign</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
a list of test cases that would thoroughly test the functions.  Be sure
to indicate the purpose of the tests.  For example, here's the beginning of a
presentation in the form of code:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The tests were performed on a map from strings to doubles
</p>
<pre>
  // default constructor
Map m;
  // For an empty map:
assert(m.size() == 0);      // test size
assert(m.empty());          // test empty
assert(!m.erase("Ricky"));  // nothing to erase
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even if you do not correctly implement all the functions, you must still list
test cases that would test them.  Don't lose points by thinking "Well, I didn't
implement this function, so I won't bother saying how I would have tested it
if I <em>had</em> implemented it."

</ul>
