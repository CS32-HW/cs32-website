<h2>g++ with Linux</h2>
<p>
Every program you submit as source files must run successfully on the
SEASnet Linux server cs32.seas.ucla.edu using the g32 command we have set
up, which is merely a special way of running g++ that catches more kinds
of errors during execution.
</p><p>
What we're presenting here is a minimal set of instructions for helping a
Windows or Mac user transfer a C++ program to that SEASnet Linux server to
build and run.  There are other ways to do this than what we show; the
more you know about Linux, the more you can simplify or eliminate certain
steps.
</p><p>
Let's assume you have a Visual C++ or an Xcode project consisting of the
three source files from the <a href="visualcpp.html">Visual C++</a>
writeup or the <a href="xcode.html">Xcode on a Mac</a> writeup:
<code>VoiceMail.h</code>, <code>VoiceMail.cpp</code>, and
<code>testVoiceMail.cpp</code>.  (Note: It is inconvenient in Linux if the
name of a file contains space characters, so avoid giving your files such
names.)  Here's what to do to run the program on the SEASnet cs32 Linux
server:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
First, note that you will be able to log into that SEASnet Linux server only
from
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a machine on the wired UCLA campus network (not behind the dorm firewall), or
</li><li>
the Windows-based remote
<a href="https://www.seasnet.ucla.edu/setting-up-remoteapps-and-remote-desktop/"
target="_blank">SEASnet Remote Desktop</a>; or
</li><li>
another machine (e.g., your own machine connected by WiFi or off-campus),
provided you first connect to the
<a href="https://www.it.ucla.edu/bol/services/virtual-private-network-vpn-clients"
target="_blank">UCLA VPN</a> (Virtual Private Network) server, which
makes it look like your machine is on the campus network.  If you have trouble
connecting to a SEASnet Linux server,
<a href="https://www.seasnet.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">contact SEASnet</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li><li>
<p>
Windows users:  Install PuTTY on your own computer; a
<a href="https://www.seasnet.ucla.edu/putty/" target="_blank">SEASnet
writeup</a> tells you how.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Create a zip file containing your three source files.  Let's suppose you
named the zip file <code>VM.zip</code>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Copy the zip file to the SEASnet Linux server.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Mac users:  Put the zip file onto your Mac desktop and launch the Terminal
application.  In Terminal, run the command <code>scp Desktop/VM.zip
<em>yourSEASaccount</em>@cs32.seas.ucla.edu:</code> (notice the colon at the
end, no space before it), and enter your SEASnet account password when
prompted.  This copies your file from your Mac to the SEASnet cs32 Linux
server.
</p><p>
If that command results in a scary warning about DNS spoofing, then run
the command <code>ssh <em>yourSEASaccount</em>@cs32.seas.ucla.edu
date</code> and answer yes to the question it asks.  Then try the
<code>scp</code> command again.  Alternatively, instead of using the name
cs32.seas.ucla.edu, use one of the names lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu or
lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu or lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu consistently in this and
subsequent steps.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Windows users:  Install <a href="https://winscp.net/"
target="_blank">WinSCP</a> on your computer.  There is a
<a href="https://winscp.net/eng/docs/getting_started" target="_blank">Quick
Start Guide</a>.  Use WinSCP to transfer the file to cs32.seas.ucla.edu,
providing your SEASnet login name and password.
</p><p>
If you don't want to install WinSCP, then in a browser on your Windows
machine, navigate to <a href="https:file.io"
target="_blank">https://file.io</a>, click the Upload button and upload
your file, and note the link you're told in response (which will be of the
form <code>https://file.io/<em>XXXXXX</em></code>).  You will complete the
file transfer once you log into the Linux server in the next step.
</p></li>
</ul>
</li><li>
<p>
Log in to the SEASnet cs32 Linux server.  Here's how:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Mac users:  From the Terminal application, run the command <code>ssh
<em>yourSEASaccount</em>@cs32.seas.ucla.edu</code> and enter your SEASnet
account password when prompted.  This logs you into the cs32 Linux server.
If you get a message about the authenticity of cs32.seas.ucla.edu not being
able to be established, answer yes to the question asking you if you want to
continue.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Windows users:  Launch PuTTY and type <code>cs32.seas.ucla.edu</code> for
the Host Name in the dialog box.  If a dialog box titled "PuTTY Security
Alert" appears, click its Yes button.  In the PuTTY console window (titled
something like "lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu - PuTTY"), log in to the Linux
server with your SEASnet login name.  When prompted for your password,
type it in; the characters you type for your password will not produce
anything on the screen, not even bullets.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
You will now be interacting on the remote Linux server with the command
interpreter program (the <em>shell</em>), whose default prompt is something
like <code>bash-5.0$</code> or <code>[<em>yourname</em>@lnxsrv07 ~]$</code>. 
For each command you type, the shell will execute it and then prompt you
for the next command.  The shell is case-sensitive, so pay attention to
the distinction between lower and upper case.
</p><p>
Windows users who used https://file.io:  To complete the file transfer,
run the command
</p>
<pre>
	curl -s -L https://file.io/<em>XXXXXX</em> > VM.zip
</pre>
<p>
where <em>XXXXXX</em> are the characters at the end of the link you were told
in response to your upload.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
On the Linux server, verify that the zip file arrived OK by running the command
</p>
<pre>
	zipinfo VM.zip
</pre>
<p>
which should show you what files were zipped into VM.zip.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Our special way of running g++ is via a new command, g32, which you will have
to set up.  If you have never previously run the following command, run it
now on the SEASnet Linux server; you will never have to run it again.  If
you do run it again, it will confirm that you are set up for running g32
on the SEASnet Linux server.
</p>
<pre>
	setupg32
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>
Unbundle the zip file into its own directory called, say, <code>proj0</code>:
</p>
<pre>
	unzip -j -a -d proj0 VM.zip
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>
Make <code>proj0</code> the <em>current directory</em> (i.e., the default
directory for now in which files will be found or created):
</p>
<pre>
	cd proj0
</pre>
<p>
Like many Linux commands, if this command works, it doesn't say anything, so
the shell would then just print its next prompt.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Verify that the expected three files are present by listing the contents of
the current directory:
</p>
<pre>
	ls
</pre>
<p>
File names in Linux are case-sensitive.  You'll have a problem if one of
your .cpp files says <code>#include "VoiceMail.h"</code> but the
.h file is named <code>voicemail.h</code>.  You could use the
move command to change the name of the file:
</p>
<pre>
	mv voicemail.h VoiceMail.h
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>
Build an executable file from the source files.  If we would like the
executable file to be named <code>vm</code>, we'd say
</p>
<pre>
	g32 -o vm *.cpp
</pre>
<p>
The <code>*.cpp</code> saves us typing individual file names by matching
all the files whose names end in <code>.cpp</code>.  Notice that we do
<strong>not</strong> list any <code>.h</code> files.  (If you mistakenly
list any <code>.h</code> files, this command produces for each such file
a file whose name ends in <code>.h.gch</code> that might cause later
compilations to produce confusing error messages.)
</p><p>
(You don't have to know this, but the setup process in step 7 modified the
file <code>~/.profile</code> to create a bash function that causes the
above command to be executed as if it were <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/g++
-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Werror=return-type 
-Wl,--rpath=/usr/local/cs/lib64 -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined
-fsanitize=bounds -fno-omit-frame-pointer -o vm *.cpp</code> instead.  The
<code>/usr/local/cs/bin/g++</code>
invokes g++ version 10.2.0; the SEASnet server's default is version 4.8.5. 
The <code>-std=c++17</code> enables C++17 language features.  The
<code>-Wall</code> option asks the compiler to warn you about many
questionable constructs; the <code>-Wextra -Wno-sign-compare</code> asks
for warnings about even more questionable constructs.  The
<code>-Werror=return-type</code> causes a certain warning to be treated as
an error.  The other added options cause certain runtime errors to
terminate your program with an error message instead of silently
continuing and wreaking havoc.)
</p><p>
Compiler diagnostic messages are of the form
</p>
<pre>
	<em>fileName</em>:<em>lineNumber</em>:<em>columnNumber</em>:<em>message</em>
</pre>
<p>
If the compiler detects any problems that you want to fix, then since we're
assuming you're doing your primary development using Visual C++ or Xcode,
you should make changes to your original Windows or Mac files.  After
checking in Visual C++ or Xcode that the modified program works as you
expect it to, go back to step 1.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
To execute the program <code>vm</code> that you built, you'd just say
</p>
<pre>
	vm
</pre>
<p>
(If that doesn't work, try
</p>
<pre>
	./vm
</pre>
<p>
instead.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
To exit the shell, say
</p>
<pre>
	exit
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you want to examine a file under Linux, a simple text editor you can use is
Nano.
</p>
<pre>
	nano testVoiceMail.cpp
</pre>
<p>
You can navigate with the arrow keys.  The bottom two lines of the display
show you some commands you can type.  For example, control-C (indicated in
the bottom display as <code>^C</code>) shows you what line number the cursor
is on.  Control-O saves any changes you make to the file, and control-X exits
the editor.
</p><p>
We strongly recommend that you don't test your program using g32 just once,
only after you're satisfied with it under Visual C++ or Xcode.  Instead, do it
periodically during your development, and certainly do it when you're trying
to find an elusive bug.  Sometimes people have spent hours trying to track
down a problem during execution using Visual C++ when the g32 command
would have immediately given them a warning that pointed to the mistake.
Also, sometimes a program that appeared to work correctly under Visual C++
or Xcode relied on undefined behavior, but happened to get lucky for the
student in a way that wasn't reproduced when we tested the program;
testing using g32 might have shown different behavior, which would have
suggested to the student that something was amiss.
