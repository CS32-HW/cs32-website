We anticipate that many people working on Project 3 will spend a lot of
time debugging something that arises from a common novice misunderstanding.
To save you that time later, we'll give you a chance to make that mistake
in a simpler context, so you can work out that issue and how it manifests
itself.  (It may turn out that you don't have that misunderstanding, so
you won't have any issues doing this problem.  Still, keep this problem
in mind, because you may still make the mistake in Project 3.)
</p><p>
Be especially sure to run your code for this problem under g32 to help
ensure that there are no pointer/iterator violations or memory leaks which
that common misunderstandings may lead to.

Implement the <code>removeOdd</code> function; you must use

once.

Explain in a sentence or two what happens during the execution of test case 3
that eventually leads to test case 3 failing.

<p>
The files <a href="Map.h">Map.h</a> and <a href="Map.cpp">Map.cpp</a>
contain the definition and implementation of Map implemented using a
doubly-linked list.  A client who wants to use a Map has to change the
type alias declarations in Map.h, and within one source file, cannot have
two Maps containing different types.
</p><p>
Eliminate the <code>using</code> statements defining the type aliases, and
change Map to be a class template, so that a client can say
</p>
<pre>
    #include "Map.h"
    #include &lt;string>
    using std::string;
    ...
    Map&lt;int, double> mid;
    Map&lt;string, int> msi;
    mid.insert(42, -1.25);
    msi.insert("Fred", 123);
    ...
</pre>
<p>
Also, change <code>merge</code> and <code>reassign</code> to be function
templates.
</p><p>
(Hint:  Transforming the solution based on type aliases is a mechanical
task that takes five minutes if you know what needs to be done.  What
makes this problem non-trivial for you is that you haven't done it before;
the syntax for declaring templates is new to you, so you may not get it
right the first time.)
<!--
Have you looked at Chapter 8, pp. 419-426?)
-->
</p><p>
(Hint:  Template typename parameters don't have to be named with single
letters like <code>T</code>; they can be names of your choosing.  You might
find that by choosing the names <code>KeyType</code> and
<code>ValueType</code>, you'll have many fewer changes to make.)
</p><p>
(Hint:  The Node struct nested in the Map class can talk about the template
parameters of the Map class; the Node struct itself should not be a
struct/class template.)
</p><p>
The declarations <em>and</em> implementations of your Map class template
and the <code>merge</code> and <code>reassign</code> template functions
must be in just one file, Map.h, which is all that you will turn in for
this problem.  Although the implementation of a non-template non-inline
function should not be placed in a header file (because of linker problems
if that header file were included in multiple source files), the
implementation of a template function, whether or not it's declared
inline, <em>can</em> be in a header file without causing linker problems,
and in fact the header file is the normal place to put it in most C++
environments.
</p><p>
There's a pre-C++20 language technicality that relates to a type declared
inside a class template, like <code>N</code> below:
</p>
<pre>
    template &lt;typename T>
    class M
    {
      ...
      struct N
      {
        ...
      };
      N* f();
      ...
    };
</pre>
<p>
The technicality affects how we specify the return type of a function
(such as <code>M&lt;T>::f</code>) when that return type uses a type defined
inside a template class (such as <code>M&lt;T>::N</code>).  If we attempt to
implement <code>f</code> this way:
</p>
<pre>
    template &lt;typename T>
    M&lt;T>::N* M&lt;T>::f()    // Error!  Won't compile in C++17 or earlier.
    {
      ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
the pre-C++20 technicality requires the compiler to not recognize
<code>M&lt;T>::N</code> as a type name; it must be announced as a type name
this way:
</p>
<pre>
    template &lt;typename T>
    typename M&lt;T>::N* M&lt;T>::f()    // OK in all C++ versions
    {
      ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
Giving g32 the <code>-std=c++20</code> option will cause it to use C++20.
We will test your code with C++17, unless it doesn't compile, in which case
we'll test it with C++20 instead.
</p>
<p>
For you to not get a score of zero for this problem, this test program
that we will try with your <code>Map.h</code> <strong>must</strong> build
and execute successfully under both g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++,
with no <code>Map.cpp</code> file on the command line (for g32) or as part
of the project (for Visual C++ or Xcode):

Consider this program:
</p>
<pre>
    #include "Map.h"  // class template from problem 2

    class Coord
    {
      public:
        Coord(double r, double c) : m_r(r), m_c(c) {}
        Coord() : m_r(0), m_c(0) {}
        double r() const { return m_r; }
        double c() const { return m_c; }
      private:
        double m_r;
        double m_c;
    };

    int main()
    {
        Map&lt;int, double> mid;
        mid.insert(42, -1.25);         // OK
        Map&lt;Coord, int> mpi;
	    mpi.insert(Coord(40,10), 32);  // error!
	}
</pre>
<p>
Explain in a sentence or two why the call to
<code>Map&lt;Coord, int>::insert</code> causes at least one compilation
error.  (Notice that the call to <code>Map&lt;int, double>::insert</code>
is fine.)  Don't just transcribe a compiler error message; your answer
must indicate you understand the the ultimate root cause of the problem
and why that is connected to the call to
<code>Map&lt;Coord, int>::insert</code>.

An Internet domain has a <em>label</em> (e.g., <code>edu</code>) and zero or
more <em>subdomains</em> (e.g., the subdomain labeled <code>ucla</code> and
the subdomain labeled <code>caltech</code> are subdomains of the domain labeled
<code>edu</code>).  The root domain has the empty string as its label. 
The following program reflects this structure:

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;string>
#include &lt;vector>

using namespace std;

class Domain
{
  public:
    Domain(string lbl) : m_label(lbl) {}
    string label() const { return m_label; }
    const vector&lt;Domain*>&amp; subdomains() const { return m_subdomains; }
    void add(Domain* d) { m_subdomains.push_back(d); }
    ~Domain();
  private:
    string m_label;
    vector&lt;Domain*> m_subdomains;
};

Domain::~Domain()
{
    for (size_t k = 0; k &lt; m_subdomains.size(); k++)
        delete m_subdomains[k];
}

void listAll(string path, const Domain* d) // two-parameter overload
{
    <em>You will write this code.</em>
}

void listAll(const Domain* d)  // one-parameter overload
{
    if (d != nullptr)
        listAll(d->label(), d);
}

int main()
{
    Domain* d1 = new Domain("ucla");
    d1->add(new Domain("cs"));
    d1->add(new Domain("ee"));
    d1->add(new Domain("math"));
    Domain* d2 = new Domain("caltech");
    d2->add(new Domain("math"));
    d2->add(new Domain("cs"));
    Domain* d3 = new Domain("edu");
    d3->add(d1);
    d3->add(d2);
    Domain* d4 = new Domain("com");
    d4->add(new Domain("microsoft"));
    d4->add(new Domain("apple"));
    Domain* d5 = new Domain("biz");
    Domain* root = new Domain("");
    root->add(d3);
    root->add(d4);
    root->add(d5);
    listAll(root);
    cout &lt;&lt; "====" &lt;&lt; endl;
    listAll(d2);
    cout &lt;&lt; "====" &lt;&lt; endl;
    listAll(d5);
    delete root;
}
</pre>
<p>
When the listAll function is called from the main routine above, the following
output should be produced (the first line written is <code>cs.ucla.edu</code>,
not an empty line):
</p>
<pre>
cs.ucla.edu
ee.ucla.edu
math.ucla.edu
math.caltech.edu
cs.caltech.edu
microsoft.com
apple.com
biz

<p>
Each call to the one-parameter overload of <code>listAll</code> produces a
list, one per line, of all the leaf domain names in the domain tree rooted
at <code>listAll</code>'s argument.  A domain name is a sequence of labels
separated by periods. There is no period before the (empty) label of the
root domain.
</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>
You are to write the code for the two-parameter overload of
<code>listAll</code> to make this happen.  You must not use any additional
container (such as a stack), and the two-parameter overload of
<code>listAll</code> must be recursive.  You must not use any global
variables or variables declared with the keyword <code>static</code>, and
you must not modify any of the code we have already written or add new
functions.  You may use a loop to traverse the vector; you must not use
loops to avoid recursion.
</p><p>
Here's a useful function to know:  The standard library string class has a
+ operator that concatenates strings and/or characters.  For example,
</p>
<pre>
	string s("Hello");
	string t("there");
	string u = s + ", " + t + '!';
	// Now u has the value "Hello, there!"
</pre>
<p>
It's also useful to know that if you choose to traverse an STL container
using some kind of iterator, then if the container is const, you must use
a <code>const_iterator</code>:
</p>
<pre>
	void f(const list&lt;int>&amp; c)  // c is const
	{
	    for (list&lt;int>::const_iterator it = c.begin(); it != c.end(); it++)
	        cout &lt;&lt; *it &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
<p>
(Of course, a vector can be traversed either by using some kind of iterator,
or by using operator[] with an integer argument). 
</p><p>
For this problem, you will turn a file named <code>list.cpp</code> with
the body of the two-parameter overload of the <code>listAll</code>
function, from its "void" to its "}", no more and no less.  Your function
must compile and work correctly when substituted into the program above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We introduced the two-parameter overload of <code>listAll</code>. Why
could you not solve this problem given the constraints in part a if we had
only a one-parameter <code>listAll</code>, and you had to implement <em>it</em>
as the recursive function?

In order to prepare for the inevitable spread of another dangerous virus, the
local health department is developing software that maintains, for N people
numbered 0 through N-1, a two-dimensional array of bool
<code>hasContacted</code> that records which people have been in close
contact with others: <code>hasContacted[i][j]</code> is true if and only if
person i and person j have been in close contact.  If person i has been in
close contact with person k, and person k has been in close contact with
person j, we call person k a <em>direct intermediary</em> between person i
and person j.
</p>
<p>
The department has develped an algorithm that, for every pair of people i and
j, determines how many direct intermediaries they have between them.  Here's
the code:
</p>
<pre>
	const int N = <em>some value</em>;
	bool hasContacted[N][N];
	...
	int numIntermediaries[N][N];
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
	{
	    numIntermediaries[i][i] = -1;  // the concept of intermediary
	                                   // makes no sense in this case
	    for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
	    {
	        if (i == j)
	            continue;
	        numIntermediaries[i][j] = 0;
	        for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
	        {
	            if (k == i  ||  k == j)
	                continue;
	            if (hasContacted[i][k]  &amp;&amp;  hasContacted[k][j])
	                numIntermediaries[i][j]++;
	        }
	    }
	}
</pre>
<p>
What is the time complexity of this algorithm, in terms of the number of
basic operations (e.g., additions, assignments, comparisons) performed:
Is it O(N), O(N log N), or what?  Why?  (Note:  In this homework, whenever
we ask for the time complexity, we care only about the high order term, so
don't give us answers like O(N<sup>4</sup>+7N<sup>2</sup>).)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The algorithm in part a doesn't take advantage of the symmetry of contact:
for every pair of persons i and j, hasContacted[i][j] == hasContacted[j][i]. 
One can skip a lot of operations and compute the number of direct
intermediaries more quickly with this algorithm:
</p>
<pre>
	const int N = <em>some value</em>;
	bool hasContacted[N][N];
	...
	int numIntermediaries[N][N];
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
	{
	    numIntermediaries[i][i] = -1;  // the concept of intermediary
	                                   // makes no sense in this case
	    for (int j = 0; j &lt; <strong>i</strong>; j++)  <strong>// loop limit is now i, not N</strong>
	    {
	        numIntermediaries[i][j] = 0;
	        for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
	        {
	            if (k == i  ||  k == j)
	                continue;
	            if (hasContacted[i][k]  &amp;&amp;  hasContacted[k][j])
	                numIntermediaries[i][j]++;
	        }
	        <strong>numIntermediaries[j][i] = numIntermediaries[i][j];</strong>
	    }
	}

Here again is the non-member <code>reassign</code> function for Map

          // Insert a final pair with last pair's key and pair 0's value.

Assume that <code>m</code> and the old value of <code>result</code> each

Here is an implementation of a related member function.  The call

The file <a href="sorts.cpp">sorts.cpp</a> contains an almost
complete program that creates a randomly ordered array, sorts it in a few
ways, and reports on the elapsed times.  Your job is to complete it and
experiment with it.
</p><p>
You can run the program as is to get some results for the STL sort algorithm.
You won't get any result for insertion sort, because the insertion sort
function right now doesn't do anything.  That's one thing for you to write.
</p><p>
The objects in the array might not be cheap to copy (it depends on your
processor), which might make a sort that does a lot of moving objects around
expensive.  Your other task will be to create a vector of
<em>pointers</em> to the objects, sort the pointers using the same
criterion as was used to sort the objects, and then make one pass through
the vector to put the objects in the proper order.
</p><p>
Your two tasks are thus:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Implement the <code>insertion_sort</code> function.  (Code is on pp.
332-333 in the Carrano book, and also <a href="bookcode.html">here</a>.)
</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the <code>compareSensorPtr</code> function and the code in
<code>sortUsingPtrs</code> to create and sort the array of pointers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The places to make modifications are indicated by <code>TODO:</code> comments.
You should not have to make modifications anywhere else.  (Our solution
doesn't.)
</p>
<a id="optimize"></a>
<p>
When your program is correct, build an optimized version of it to do some
timing experiments.  On cs32.seas.ucla.edu, build the executable and run
it this way:
</p>
<pre>
	g32fast -o sorts sorts.cpp
	./sorts
</pre>
<p>
(You don't have to know this, but this command omits some of the runtime
error checking compiler options that our g32 command supplies, and it adds
the -O2 compiler option that causes the compiler to spend more time
optimizing the machine language translation of your code so that it will
run faster when you execute it.)
</p><p>
Under Xcode, select Product / Scheme / Edit Scheme....  In the left panel,
select Run, then in the right panel, select the Info tab.  In the Build
Configuration dropdown, select Release.  For Visual C++, it's
<a href="vcreleasemode.html">a little trickier</a>.
</p><p>
Try the program with about 10000 items.  Depending on the speed of your
processor, this number may be too large or small to get meaningful timings
in a reasonable amount of time.  Experiment.  Once you get insertion sort
working, observe the O(N<sup>2</sup>) behavior by sorting, say, 10000,
20000, and 40000 items.
</p><p>
To further observe the performance behavior of the STL sort algorithm, try
sorting, say, 100000, 200000, and 400000 items, or even ten times as many.
Since this would make the insertion sort tests take a long time, skip
them by setting the TEST_INSERTION_SORT constant at the top of sorts.cpp to
false.  (<strong>Note for Visual C++ users</strong>:  There's a default limit
for the maximum heap size during execution, so you may get strange behavior
for a vector of about 400000 or more of our items.  If you like, you can
change this in the project's Property Pages, Configuration Properties /
Linker / System, Heap Commit Size value.)
</p><p>
Notice that if you run the program more than once, you may not get exactly
the same timings each time.  This is partly because of not getting the
same sequence of random numbers each time, but also because of factors
like caching by the operating system.
